Axiom is a Web3 trading terminal that solves the black box problem of unverifiable data. We use the Stellar blockchain as a public notary. When we issue a Whale Alert we publish it on-chain. Our Verify button lets users fetch the cryptographic proof from the Stellar API. We sell verifiable trust, not just data, and add an AI co-pilot for insights.
